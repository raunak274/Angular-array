# Array in angular

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array

# forEach() vs map()
Well, the forEach() method doesn’t actually return anything (undefined). It simply calls a provided function on each element in your array. This callback is allowed to mutate the calling array.

Meanwhile, the map() method will also call a provided function on every element in the array. The difference is that map() utilizes return values and actually returns a new Array of the same size.

# Sort 
The sort() method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. The default sort order is ascending, built upon converting the elements into strings, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units values.

## sample
const months = ['March', 'Jan', 'Feb', 'Dec'];
months.sort();
console.log(months);
// expected output: Array ["Dec", "Feb", "Jan", "March"]

const array1 = [1, 30, 4, 21, 100000];
array1.sort();
console.log(array1);
// expected output: Array [1, 100000, 21, 30, 4]
